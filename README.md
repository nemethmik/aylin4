# aylin4
A series of experimental projects for Angular/TypeScript/PrimeNG arranged in branches [Aylin Sarioglu](https://www.vakifbanksporkulubu.com/en/news-details/Aylin-Sarioglu-signed-with-VakifBank-n2055)
The project has three major parts:
- a4warehouse is the backend service (Express/TypeScript/MongoDB)
- tatyana15 is an NX monorepo for the storefront and administration Angular applications (Tatyana Kosheleva)
    - t15shop is the shopping cart application for the customers (Angular/TypeScript)
    - t15storeadmin is the administration application for the store owner/admin to manage orders, products, customers (Angular/PrimeNG)
- netninjawebpacktutorial is just what it means
Originally I created tatyana as a standalone folder, then I copied it under aylin4 and deleted the .git folder, this way tatyana15 nicely integrated into the aylin4 repo.

All of these projects were put on hold. For reasons check out the readmes under each directory.
