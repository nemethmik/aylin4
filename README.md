# aylin4
A series of experimental projects for Angular/TypeScript/PrimeNG arranged in branches (Aylin Sarioglu)
The project has three major parts:
- a4warehouse is the backend service (Express/TypeScript/MongoDB)
- tatyana15 is an NX monorepo for the storefront and administration Angular applications (Tatyana Kosheleva)
    - t15shop is the shopping cart application for the customers (Angular/TypeScript)
    - t15storeadmin is the administration application for the store owner/admin to manage orders, products, customers (Angular/PrimeNG)
- netninjawebpacktutorial is just what it means
Originally I created tatyana as a standalone folder, then I copied it under aylin4 and deleted the .git folder, this way tatyana15 nicely integrated into the aylin4 repo.
