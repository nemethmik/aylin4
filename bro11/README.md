Name given after [Yulia Brovkina](yuliabrovkina2021.jpg) (number 11) from Russian volleybal team in 2021. 

**I put this project on halt**, since it is not worth the effort. 
React is simple enough, honestly, just check out a number of from-scratch (no CRA) project setup with either webpack, parcel or a number of other bundlers.
[Creating A React App From Scratch Using Snowpack 2021](https://youtu.be/QAwW0E9BXKc) or [React, Typescript and Sass with Parcel - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdFaLrzfDB0).
In this regard React is really a simple system, a lot simpler than Angular, which I love too. 

----

After giving a couple of hours to experimenting with Webpack, I decided to work with Parcel because of its zero-configuration design, it fits nicely to the simple development tool-set I am aiming to use. 
- [React, Typescript and Sass with Parcel - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdFaLrzfDB0) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px_2JE1vBkI) in this example React is configured with Parcel in a very simple way. The author there later switched over to webpack, which is far the most popular bundler.
- [Parcel JS Setups Walkthrough and Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3EZ9dvjuHI) is a detailed explanation from 2021.
- [HTML include](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp) shows an example Java script without JQuery to include dynamically HTML blocks dynamically from HTML files.

For testing websites in Visual Studio Code a great tool is [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Warning: Before installing *parcel* make a **.gitignore** to exclude *node_modules* otherwise git is not willing to work any more.
- **npm i -D parcel typescript** parcel is a gigantic package with a hell lot of deprecated references, unfortunately. This installed parcel@2.0.0-rc.0 on my system on Aug 28, 2021.
